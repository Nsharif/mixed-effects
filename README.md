code and paper on developing multilevel models for change (aka mixed effects/hierarchical models).

to understand level-1 and level-2 submodels read the attached paper 'mixed-effects-analysis'

Abstract:
In this paper, I will be introducing the statistical multilevel model for change, demonstrating how it allows us to address within-individual and between-individual questions about change simultaneously. I begin by specifying the multilevel model for change while postulating a pair of subsidiary modelsâ€”a level-1 submodel that describes how each individual change over time, and a level-2 submodel that describes how the changes differ across individuals. I then follow up with a composite model that collapses the level-1 and level-2 submodels together algebraically. A distinctive feature of the composite multilevel model is its composite residual. The mathematical form of the composite residual reveals two import properties about the residuals not readily apparent in the level-1 and level-2 specification: they can be both autocorrelated and heteroskedastic within individual.
