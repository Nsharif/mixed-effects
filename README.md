# mixed-effects
This repository is about mixed effects models (commonly known as multilevel models os hiearchical models).

Attached is a pdf paper that you can use to follow allowing when doing data analysis on multilevel models. Additionaly, the R code is available. Note, the data is proprietary and only available internally within Kaiser Permanente. Therefore, external users will not have access to the data.

Abstract:
In this paper, I will be introducing the statistical multilevel model for change, demonstrating how it allows us to address within-individual and between-individual questions about change simultaneously. I begin by specifying the multilevel model for change while postulating a pair of subsidiary modelsâ€”a level-1 submodel that describes how each individual change over time, and a level-2 submodel that describes how the changes differ across individuals. I then follow up with a composite model that collapses the level-1 and level-2 submodels together algebraically. A distinctive feature of the composite multilevel model is its composite residual. The mathematical form of the composite residual reveals two import properties about the residuals not readily apparent in the level-1 and level-2 specification: they can be both autocorrelated and heteroskedastic within individual.
